        Increase practice frequency, not duration. Who would improve faster: Stu, who practices once a week for 4 hours straight, or Merle, who practices every day for 20 minutes? I'd bet on Merle, even though Stu spends almost twice as much time practicing. This is because, after you've spent time practicing something, your brain continues to work on it and make new neural connections in the background, even while sleeping (especially while sleeping!). For this reason, I recommend bookmarking your favorite exercises and doing them every day for a set amount of time.
